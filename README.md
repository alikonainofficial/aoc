# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! 🎄✨ This repository contains my personal solutions to the programming challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles during December.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and day for easy navigation. Each year has its own parent directory, and inside, there are subdirectories for each day’s challenge.

- 2023/
  - Day 1/
  - Day 2/
  - ...
- 2024/
  - Day 1/
  - Day 2/
  - ...

## Inside Each Day’s Folder

Each Day X folder typically contains:
	•	Solution Code: My implementation of the solution for that day’s problem (e.g., solution.py, solution.js, etc.).
	•	Input Data: The problem’s input data (input.txt).
	•	Notes or Explanation (optional): A brief explanation or comments on the approach used (README.md or inline comments in the code).

## 🚀 Usage

  1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aoc.git
    cd aoc

  2. Navigate to the year and day of interest:

    cd 2023/Day\ 1
    

  3. Run the solution file in your preferred programming environment.


## 🛠️ Technologies

The solutions are implemented in JavaScript 🟨
